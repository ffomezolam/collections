collections
===========

Compilation of quirky collection classes for javascript

modules
-------

`closecoll` fuzzy selection ([repo](http://github.com/ffomezolam/closecoll))

`roulette` random selection using the roulette method ([repo](http://github.com/ffomezolam/roulette))

verify script
-------------

The `verify.js` script is supposed to check a javascript module to see if it comports with the interface I'm trying to conform to with these.
